Based on windows ,using tensorflow c++ api to predict.

Firstly, you need to unzip 3rd.rar, I compress it in order to upload to github more easier.

Secondly ,I build this demo on visual studio 2015.

Thirdly, you can refer to https://github.com/rockingdingo/tensorflow-tutorial/ to get the workflow of how to get pb file.
